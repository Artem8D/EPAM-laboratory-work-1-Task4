DZ Deathrays Still No Change Lyrics

You wanted a change out of me
But nothing feels quite right
You wanted a change out of this
But nothing’s right
You wanted a change out of me
But nothing feels quite right
It’s just the same old thing
It happens in time
Calling out there’s something that I’m holding on
Cough it up there’s something you won’t talk about
When the changes are all you ever focus on
It makes it hard to see what we’ve been working on
My sentiment
Keeps changing
I kinda feel the same now
 
You wanted a change out of me
But nothing feels quite right
You wanted a change out of this
But nothing’s right
You wanted a change out of me
But nothing feels quite right
It’s just the same old thing
It happens in time
